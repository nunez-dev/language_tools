How many threads (default:10)? What matching pattern should be used with IPA descriptions to prioritise an IPA if there are multiple?
This was implemented to be able to prioritise certain geographies.
Some IPAs have for example (Spain) or (Latin America) before them.
L+ or "Latin America" would match the latter (it's regex).
Default will prioritise the first encountered phonetic IPA
(default:"")? What language? What part of speech/lemma?
